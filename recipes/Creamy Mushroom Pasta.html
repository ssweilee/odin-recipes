        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>¾ pound fresh white mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>¼ pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 fluid ounces sherry</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh chives</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon</li>
            <li>9 tablespoons freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain but do not rinse pasta; transfer to a large serving bowl and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir white and shiitake mushrooms in hot oil with a pinch of salt until liquid from mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir garlic into mushrooms and cook for 1 minute; pour in sherry and cook until wine is nearly evaporated. Stir in chicken stock; season with salt and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour cream into mushroom mixture, stir to combine, and simmer for 5 minutes. Mixture will foam and thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Stir thyme, chives, and tarragon into mushroom sauce and turn off heat; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into sauce until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the mushroom sauce over pasta; toss to coat. Top with remaining mushroom sauce and 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>        
        </ol>

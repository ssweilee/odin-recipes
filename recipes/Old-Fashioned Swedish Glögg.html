    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Glögg is a Swedish punch made from spiced wine. My grandfather brought this recipe over from Sweden in 1921. We still use it today. "God Jul!"</p>
        <p>This warm and cozy glögg recipe will warm you up from the inside out. If you've never celebrated the holiday season with Swedish glögg, it's time to remedy that ASAP!</p>
        <p>What Is Glögg?
            Glögg is Swedish infused wine. Usually served during the holiday season, it's similar to mulled wine — but it's not quite the same thing (glögg is a bit more involved). Traditionally, the drink is set on fire so the sugar granules completely dissolve.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Alcohol: This big batch Swedish glögg recipe is quite boozy. It calls for a combination of port wine (don't throw away the bottles!), bourbon whiskey, and white rum.</li>
            <li>Spices: The glögg gets its warm and cozy flavor from cloves, a cinnamon stick, and cardamom pods. A strip of orange peel lends fruity flavor.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Sweeten things up with ¾ cup white sugar.</li>
            <li>Raisins and almonds: Raisins and almonds lend subtle, yet welcome, flavor.</li>
            <p>Tip: Use an ordinary port wine for this recipe, because the strong-flavored spices and other ingredients will overwhelm an expensive wine.</p>
        
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the port wine. Add bourbon and rum, making sure the alcohol is warm but not simmering.</li>
            <li>Secure the spices and orange peel strip in a cheesecloth square tied with twine.</li>
            <li>Carefully light the alcohol with a long-handled match and let burn for one minute.</li>
            <li>Place the lid on the pot to extinguish the flames. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the bundled spices and let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Strain and serve, garnishing with the reserved raisins and almonds.</li>        
        </ol>
